# pjproject-sys
Rust bindings for the PJSIP Framework

This is an abandoned project of mine that i used to use pjsip in rust without needing to install it to my system.
It only works on linux.

I recommend to just install pjsip to your system and link it with the pkg_config crate and generate bindings with bindgen yourself, since it is very configurable project.
